<h1>About</h1>

<p>This is a side project of mine. I have made fcymbals  for drummers to search for cymbals easily. Website has a directory of cymbals by major manufacturers. Just type the cymbal you are looking for in search box to  find out which music stores have it.</p> 

<p>Website is work in progress. If you see anything not functioning properly or have suggestions for additional features you would like to see on the website  send me an email.</p> 

<p>If you are a store owner and I havenâ€™t included you in search results, let me know and I will include you in the listings.</p> 

<p> Hope you find it useful.</p> 

<p> Cheers,<br>
